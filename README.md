# Drone Control Projects

## Projects

### 1. Collision Drones

This module simulates scenarios where a leader drone rotates 180 degrees in place, resulting in a collision with a follower drone. 

### 2. Cross Leader with Reinforcement Learning

In this module, a leader drone rotates 180 degrees in place, similar to the Collision Drones module, but the movement of the follower drones is controlled using reinforcement learning.

### 3. One Agent

This module focuses on a scenario where a single follower drone follows the movement of a leader drone in a given environment.

- **Features**:
  - Single follower drone tracking the leader's movement
  - Basic exploration tasks for understanding following behaviors

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone http://10.110.136.81:22280/drone-group/reinforcement-learning.git
   ```
2. Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.4 are required. Make sure these versions are installed correctly. Then, install other modules compatible with these Python and CUDA versions.
